      <description>With the death of Twitter, and the fracturing of social media, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try an experiment! To that end, I&amp;rsquo;m going post some of the more interesting things I&amp;rsquo;ve read online each Thursday. I hope you find them interesting too. Or not, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to keep doing it anyway.
I&amp;rsquo;ll post links in no particular order, and they might not be recent. Just things I&amp;rsquo;ve found interesting in the previous week or so.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely thrilled to announce that, together with my wife Mars, I&amp;rsquo;ll be heading to the West and North West coasts of Tasmania to present a series of space-themed events and workshops for kids and adults alike.
We&amp;rsquo;ve called these events the West Coast Space Show. This National Science Week project is supported by the Australian Government.
This is an early step in our efforts to establish the West Coast Space Centre.</description>

      <title>Yarn Spinner for Books</title>

      <description>You already know that Yarn Spinner is one of the most powerful, flexible and innovative tools for writing interactive stories. Yarn Spinner makes it easy to write stories that run in any engine, on any platform. However, there’s one platform that we’ve neglected:
The printed page.
That’s why we’re thrilled to announce Yarn Spinner for Books. Yarn Spinner for Books allows writers to write their stories in the Yarn syntax that they know and love, and produce beautifully-typeset PDFs with their interactive stories.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s the situation. You&amp;rsquo;re a tourism information robot aboard a space station orbiting Jupiter. An asteroid will hit the station in three days, destroying it and everything on it.</description>
