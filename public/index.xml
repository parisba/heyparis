      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely thrilled to announce that, together with my wife Mars, I&amp;rsquo;ll be heading to the West and North West coasts of Tasmania to present a series of space-themed events and workshops for kids and adults alike.
We&amp;rsquo;ve called these events the West Coast Space Show. This National Science Week project is supported by the Australian Government.
This is an early step in our efforts to establish the West Coast Space Centre.</description>

      <description>Yarn Spinner is now available for purchase! We&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard to make it easier for you to get started with Yarn Spinner, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce that you can now buy Yarn Spinner on the Unity Asset Store, and the Itch Store.
Yarn Spinner will always be free and open source, but we&amp;rsquo;re excited to offer a way for you to support the project and get some extra features and support in return.</description>
