      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely thrilled to announce that, together with my wife Mars, I&amp;rsquo;ll be heading to the West and North West coasts of Tasmania to present a series of space-themed events and workshops for kids and adults alike.
We&amp;rsquo;ve called these events the West Coast Space Show. This National Science Week project is supported by the Australian Government.
This is an early step in our efforts to establish the West Coast Space Centre.</description>
