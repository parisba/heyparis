      <description>Another new book! Our latest book, written together with my wife Mars, plus friends Tim and Jon, is out! It covers everything you need to know to do simulations using Unity ML-Agents, and how to use them to train machine learning models.
You can buy it from all sorts of book shops, as well as read it on O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Online Learning platform.
You can learn about all the other books I&amp;rsquo;ve written over the (many) years here.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s finally done! My latest book, written together with my Jon, is out! It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic, visual beginners guide to Swift programming, with an emphasis on using Swift Playgrounds. I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of it.
