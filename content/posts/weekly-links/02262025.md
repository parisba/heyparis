Some new links! Huzzah!

* ["The closer to the train station, the worse the kebab" - A "Study"](https://www.jmspae.se/write-ups/kebabs-train-stations/)
* [Blogging in the age of 'AI'](https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/blogging-in-the-age-of-ai)
* [SQL Injection Court](https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2025/02/09/fixing-illinois-foia/) (also worth reading [this vaguely similar story about 32 million emails](https://mchap.io/that-time-the-city-of-seattle-accidentally-gave-me-32m-emails-for-40-dollars4997.html))

More soon!
