You already know that [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev) is one of the most powerful, flexible and innovative tools for writing interactive stories. Yarn Spinner makes it easy to write stories that run in any engine, on any platform. However, there’s one platform that we’ve neglected:

**The printed page.**

That’s why we’re thrilled to announce [Yarn Spinner for Books](https://books.yarnspinner.dev). Yarn Spinner for Books allows writers to write their stories in the Yarn syntax that they know and love, and produce beautifully-typeset PDFs with their interactive stories.

With Yarn Spinner for books, we’re revolutionising the industry by merging the ancient art of bookmaking with the thrill of interactive narratives. Readers can now enjoy the tactile pleasure of turning pages, the nostalgic scent of paper, and the sheer unpredictability of paper cuts, all while diving into rich, branching storylines.

Yarn Spinner for Books supports all of the key features of Yarn Spinner: branching options, variables, control flow, and more, all on the printed page. We can’t wait to see what you produce in this exciting and dynamic new medium. We will continue to support and maintain our offerings on legacy platforms, like computers.
