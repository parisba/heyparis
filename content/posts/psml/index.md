Another new book! Our [latest book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-simulations-for/9781492089919/), written together with my wife Mars, plus friends Tim and Jon, is out! It covers everything you need to know to do simulations using Unity ML-Agents, and how to use them to train machine learning models.

You can [buy it from all sorts of book shops](https://www.amazon.com.au/Practical-Simulations-Machine-Learning-Synthetic/dp/1492089923), as well as read it on [O'Reilly's Online Learning platform](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-simulations-for/9781492089919/).
