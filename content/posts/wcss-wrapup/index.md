The West Coast Space Show was a fantastic success! We had a great time presenting our space-themed show and activities for kids and adults alike, all around Tasmania's West and Central Coast. 

We're so grateful for the support we [received from the Australian Government via National Science Week](https://www.scienceweek.net.au/national-grant-round-recipients-for-2024/#SA1). We ran the show in Strahan, Zeehan, and Queenstown, as well as Ulverstone and Devonport, plus a quick stop in a school in Burnie. In total, we spoke to more than 255 people.

In addition to our prepared presentation on space, we took along a collection of real meoteorites (which were a huge hit with the kids), impact glass (including the local Darwin glass), and Saturn V and Space Shuttle Lego models. 

We also brought a big Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, and our brand new Seestar S50 telescope. While conditions weren't perfect, we did manage to get a nice shot or two:

Overall, the first West Coast Space Show was a wild success, and we're excited to do more things in the coming years, in the lead up to our [West Coast Space Centre](https://westcoastspacecentre.com). Stay tuned for more updates!
