## West Coast Space Show

I'm absolutely thrilled to announce that, together with my wife Mars, I'll be heading to the West and North West coasts of Tasmania to present a series of space-themed events and workshops for kids and adults alike.

We've called these events the [West Coast Soace Show](http://westcoastspacecentre.com/scienceweek2024). This National Science Week project is supported by the Australian Government.
