I'm absolutely thrilled to announce that, together with my wife [Mars](https://themartianlife.com), I'll be heading to the West and North West coasts of Tasmania to present a series of space-themed events and workshops for kids and adults alike.

We've called these events the [West Coast Space Show](http://westcoastspacecentre.com/scienceweek2024). This [National Science Week](https://scienceweek.net.au) project is supported by the Australian Government.

This is an early step in our efforts to establish the [West Coast Space Centre](https://www.westcoastspacecentre.com). You can follow our work on the web, and on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/westcoastspacecentre/).
