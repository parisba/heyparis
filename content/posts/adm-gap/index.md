The [Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme](https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/publications/report) provided one overwhelmingly clear directive: the Commonwealth needs "a consistent legal framework in which automation in government services can operate". [Recommendation 17.1](https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/publications/report) called for legislative reform, including "a clear path for those affected by decisions to seek review" and a requirement that "business rules and algorithms should be made available, to enable independent expert scrutiny".

The government "[accepted](https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/resource/download/gov-response-royal-commission-robodebt-scheme.pdf)" this recommendation. Two and a half years later, they're about to deploy AI across the entire public service without that framework in place.

Here's the timeline:

| What | When |
|------|------|
| GovAI platform operational | **April 2026** |
| Chief AI Officers appointed | July 2026 |
| Privacy Act ADM provisions commence | **10 December 2026** |
| Whole-of-government ADM legislation | *Under development* |

That's an eight-month gap where the government can deploy AI systems making decisions that "significantly affect" Australians' rights and interests, without the transparency obligations that Parliament specifically legislated for automated decision-making.

This is not an accident. It's a feature.

## What the Privacy Act Actually Requires

The [*Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2024*](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2024A00128/asmade) passed Parliament on 29 November 2024. Most provisions took effect on 10 December 2024. But the automated decision-making provisions? They don't commence until [10 December 2026](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/knowledge/publications/be98b0ff/australian-privacy-alert-parliament-passes-major-and-meaningful-privacy-law-reform), a full two years later.

When those provisions do commence, they'll insert new clauses into the Australian Privacy Principles. [APP 1.7](https://lsj.com.au/articles/the-countdown-is-on-for-automated-decision-making-transparency-requirements/) will require entities to disclose in their privacy policies when they use automated decision-making that:

- involves a computer program making, or substantially contributing to, a decision about an individual
- could reasonably be expected to significantly affect the individual's rights or interests
- uses personal information in operation

[APP 1.9](https://jws.com.au/what-we-think/practical-implications-of-new-transparency-requirements-for-automated-decision-making/) provides examples of what "significantly affects rights or interests" means:

- a decision under an Act to grant or refuse a benefit
- a decision affecting rights under a contract or arrangement
- a decision affecting access to a significant service or support

Sound familiar? These are precisely the kinds of decisions Robodebt made. Welfare payments. Debt assessments. Service eligibility. The provisions are specifically designed to catch exactly these automated government decisions.

And they won't be in force when GovAI goes live.

## What GovAI Will Actually Do

The [APS AI Plan](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/australian-public-service-ai-plan-2025/tools) describes GovAI as providing "secure, Australian-based infrastructure and tailored pathways for APS staff, teams and agencies to learn about, experiment with, and apply AI tools to improve public service delivery".

[GovAI Chat will begin APS trials from April 2026](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/9109838/public-servants-to-have-access-to-govai-chat-under-aps-ai-plan/). The goal is for "every public servant to have access to secure, supported generative AI directly from their desktop or laptop".

Minister Gallagher has [assured](https://ministers.finance.gov.au/financeminister/media-release/2025/11/12/whole-government-ai-plan-released) us that AI "is not about bringing AI in to decide that someone gets a payment or not". But that's a ministerial statement, not a legislative prohibition. It's the same category of assurance that accompanied Robodebt.

And even if we take the minister at her word about direct decisions, the Privacy Act provisions cover systems that do things "substantially and directly related to making" a decision, not just the decision itself. A generative AI that drafts assessment letters, summarises case files, or flags applications for review is covered. These are exactly the "productivity" use cases the APS AI Plan promotes.

## The Transparency Obligations That Won't Apply

From April to December 2026, AI systems deployed through GovAI won't need to comply with the new transparency requirements. That means:

**No disclosure requirement.** Agencies won't need to update their privacy policies to explain what automated decisions they're making, even as they're rolling out AI tools across their operations.

**No explanation of what personal information is used.** The new [APP 1.8](https://lsj.com.au/articles/the-countdown-is-on-for-automated-decision-making-transparency-requirements/) will require disclosure of "the kinds of personal information used in the operation of computer programs". Until December, agencies can use whatever data they like without public disclosure.

**No description of affected decisions.** APP 1.8 requires disclosure of "the kinds of decisions made solely by the operation of computer programs" and decisions where AI substantially contributes. For eight months, Australians won't have this information.

The [Law Society Journal](https://lsj.com.au/articles/the-countdown-is-on-for-automated-decision-making-transparency-requirements/) notes that "[b]ecause Privacy Policies are publicly facing documents, they are easy for the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) to proactively check for compliance". That's true, once the provisions commence. Until then, there's nothing to check.

## The Robodebt Commission Recommendations Remain Unfulfilled

The Privacy Act amendments are actually the *weaker* of the two relevant reform tracks. They're transparency obligations only. As the [practical analysis from Johnson Winter Slattery](https://jws.com.au/what-we-think/practical-implications-of-new-transparency-requirements-for-automated-decision-making/) notes, "the amendment does not require businesses to change the way they use automated systems or AI, they just require businesses to be transparent".

The *stronger* track is [Recommendation 17.1](https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/publications/report): a "consistent legal framework" for ADM with review pathways and independent scrutiny of algorithms.

Where is that framework?

The [Attorney-General's Department ran a consultation](https://consultations.ag.gov.au/integrity/adm/) between November 2024 and January 2025. They spoke with 46 stakeholders and received over 40 submissions. The [consultation paper](https://consultations.ag.gov.au/integrity/adm/user_uploads/consultation-paper-use-of-automated-decision-making-by-government.pdf) identified 46 instances of primary legislation already authorising ADM use, with provisions that "differ in their complexity".

The government's [commitment](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/members/australia/commitments/AU0024/) under the Open Government Partnership was to "introduce and implement a transparent whole-of-government legislative framework for ADM" in 2025.

It's January 2026. Where is it?

The [Law Council of Australia's submission](https://lawcouncil.au/publicassets/be8251b1-d4dd-ef11-94af-005056be13b5/4643%20-%20S%20-%20Use%20of%20automated%20decision-making%20by%20government.pdf) noted the need for "a comprehensive legislative framework to guide ADM in government" and raised concerns about "the absence of procedural fairness, transparency and contestability in decision-making". The [OAIC](https://www.oaic.gov.au/engage-with-us/submissions/agd-consultation-paper-use-of-automated-decision-making-by-government) recommended that "the legal framework for ADM align with obligations under the Privacy Act".

None of this has materialised into legislation.

## What Decisions Might Be Made During the Gap?

The Robodebt scheme ran for three years before the Federal Court declared its debt notices invalid. By then, [$2 billion in debt notices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robodebt_scheme) had been issued to 700,000 welfare recipients. [$746 million was wrongfully recovered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robodebt_scheme) from 381,000 people. [Several suicides](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-flawed-algorithm-at-the-heart-of-robodebt) were linked to the scheme.

What happens in eight months of unregulated AI deployment?

The [Attorney-General's desktop review](https://consultations.ag.gov.au/integrity/adm/user_uploads/consultation-paper-use-of-automated-decision-making-by-government.pdf) identified that ADM is already used across welfare, immigration, taxation, and trade. These are high-stakes areas where decisions affect people's livelihoods, residency, and legal status.

If GovAI tools are deployed into these areas from April 2026 (and the APS AI Plan suggests they will be, given the push for "every public servant" to have access), decisions could be made, or substantially influenced, by AI systems with:

- No public disclosure of what information is being used
- No explanation of what decisions are being made
- No clear review pathway beyond existing administrative law mechanisms that weren't designed for AI
- No independent scrutiny of the algorithms

This isn't hypothetical. The government's own [Copilot trial report](https://www.digital.gov.au/initiatives/copilot-trial/microsoft-365-copilot-evaluation-report-full/unintended-outcomes) found that the AI system could "inappropriately access sensitive information" and that 60% of users made "moderate to significant" edits to AI outputs. That trial happened in a controlled environment with willing participants. The April 2026 rollout will happen across the entire APS.

## The Commonwealth's Legal Exposure

Australian administrative law, as established in [*Pintarich v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation*](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=LIT/ICD/TAD41of2017/00001), requires a "mental process" by an authorised human officer for a decision to be legally valid. An automated output without this "requisite mental process" is not a legal decision.

The [*PGPA Act*](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2013A00123/latest/text) requires officials to exercise powers with the "degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise". The [*Public Service Act*](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00538/latest/text) requires SES employees to promote "compliance with the Code of Conduct" by personal example.

If AI systems are deployed during the gap, and those systems contribute to decisions that are later found to lack proper legal foundation, the Commonwealth faces significant legal exposure. This isn't theoretical: it's exactly what happened with Robodebt, and the government paid out [$1.75 billion in a class action settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robodebt_scheme).

The difference is that Robodebt was a rules-based system. Its algorithm could be reverse-engineered and proven unlawful. Generative AI systems are black boxes. The failure mode isn't just "we calculated the wrong number". It's "we don't know what the system did or why".

## What Should Happen

The obvious solution is simple: **don't deploy AI systems making or substantially contributing to decisions about Australians' rights until the legal framework exists**.

This would mean:

1. **Delaying GovAI Chat deployment** until after December 2026, when the Privacy Act ADM provisions commence.
2. **Limiting initial deployment** to genuinely low-risk internal productivity use cases (meeting summaries, document formatting) rather than citizen-facing decision support.
3. **Expediting the comprehensive ADM legislation** promised under Recommendation 17.1, rather than waiting for Privacy Act provisions that only cover transparency.
4. **Requiring agency-specific ADM disclosure** ahead of the statutory deadline, as voluntary best practice.

None of this appears to be happening.

Instead, the timeline runs in reverse: technology deployment first, governance framework later, legal accountability last. It's the same sequence that created Robodebt, now applied to more powerful, less explainable systems.

## The Accountability Question

When Robodebt was running, ministers assured the public that the system was lawful and fair. When it collapsed, the Royal Commission found "[venality, incompetence and cowardice](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-07-07/robodebt-royal-commission-findings-revealed/102531450)".

The current ministers are making similar assurances about GovAI: it won't make decisions about payments, it will be human-centred, there will be appropriate safeguards. But assurances aren't legislation. They're not enforceable. And when they turn out to be hollow, the people who made them are rarely the ones who suffer.

The gap between April and December 2026 is a policy choice. The government knows the Privacy Act provisions don't commence until December. They chose to deploy GovAI in April anyway. They could have aligned the timelines. They didn't.

If something goes wrong during those eight months, if AI-influenced decisions harm Australians in ways that would have been disclosed, scrutinised, or prevented under the ADM provisions, the responsibility lies with those who chose to deploy first and regulate later.

Again.
