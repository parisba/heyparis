Our [latest book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-artificial-intelligence/9781492044802/), written together with my partner Mars, plus friends Tim and Jon, is out! It covers everything you need to know to do practical AI with Swift (hence its title: Practical Artificial Intelligence with Swift, clever right?).

You can [buy it from all sorts of book shops](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Artificial-Intelligence-Swift-Fundamental/dp/1492044814), as well as read it on [O'Reilly's Online Learning platform](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-artificial-intelligence/9781492044802/).
