With the death of Twitter, and the fracturing of social media, I'm going to try an experiment! To that end, I'm going post some of the more interesting things I've read online each Thursday. I hope you find them interesting too. Or not, I don't mind. I'm just going to keep doing it anyway. 

I'll post links in no particular oder, and they might not be recent. Just things I've found interesting in the previous week or so.

Here's the first set:

* [Activision Releases Call of Duty: Warzone "Caldera" Data Set for Academic Use](https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-releases-call-of-duty-warzone-caldera-data-set) (you can [find the actual data here, on GitHub](https://github.com/Activision/caldera))
* [The Tech Industry's Flip-flop Fucking Morality](https://joanwestenberg.com/the-tech-industrys-flip-flop-fucking-morality)
* Book: [Classic Game Programming on the NES: Make your own retro video game](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-game-programming-on-the-nes) (written by another awesome Tasmanian technology person)
* [Resurrecting a dead Dune RTS game](https://wheybags.com/blog/emperor.html)
* From the "that's great, keep losing" department: [Investors Are Suddenly Getting Very Concerned That AI Isn't Making Any Serious Money](https://futurism.com/investors-concerned-ai-making-money)

More next week!
