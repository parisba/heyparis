The [APS AI Plan](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/australian-public-service-ai-plan-2025/what-we-plan-achieve) makes a bold claim: "By 2030, AI adoption could lift public sector gross value added by 13 per cent, delivering $19 billion in annual value."

This is presented as justification for the government's aggressive AI deployment timeline. It's cited in ministerial statements and echoed in press coverage. It sounds impressive.

But where does the $19 billion figure come from? What assumptions underpin it? And how does it square with the government's own Copilot trial, which found that most users couldn't find meaningful value in AI tools?

Let's trace the claims to their sources.

## The $19 Billion Figure

The APS AI Plan cites "Merom, 2025" as the source for its $19 billion claim. This refers to [*AI in Australia: OpenAI's Economic Blueprint*](https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/61b341bc-56eb-46dc-b356-a621e02cb82d/openai-australia-economic-blueprint-july-2025.pdf), a report prepared by consultant Shahar Merom.

The report was [funded by OpenAI](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2025/openai-spruiks-142b-ai-opportunity-for-australia.html) and produced in partnership with the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Computer Society, COSBOA, and the AIIA.

Let me repeat that: **the government's productivity justification for AI deployment comes from a report funded by the company selling the AI systems being deployed**.

This is like citing tobacco industry research on the health benefits of smoking. The conflict of interest is so obvious it shouldn't need explaining.

## The Broader $142 Billion Claim

The Merom report's headline figure is actually [$142 billion annually to Australia's GDP by 2030](https://cfotech.com.au/story/ai-set-to-boost-australia-s-economy-by-up-to-aud-142-billion). The breakdown:

- $112 billion from AI adoption across the economy
- $18 billion from domestic AI industry (data centres, software)
- $11 billion from exports

The public sector's $19 billion is part of the adoption component.

But look at how conditional this language is. The report says AI "*could*" add these amounts. It identifies "limited compute infrastructure, skills shortages, and [low] public trust in AI systems" as barriers. The figures assume these barriers are overcome. They assume optimal adoption. They assume benefits materialise as projected.

This isn't a forecast. It's a best-case scenario produced by people with financial incentives to promote AI adoption.

## The Productivity Commission's More Sober Assessment

The [Productivity Commission's interim report](https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/current/data-digital/interim) on AI is more measured. It projects AI could "add more than $116 billion to Australian economic activity over the next decade", translating to a potential 4.3% increase in labour productivity growth.

Even this is described as potential, not certain. And the Commission notes that "[monitoring of progress and thorough retrospective evaluation of impact remain underdeveloped aspects of government AI implementation](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287/full-report/implementation-challenges-that-hinder-the-strategic-use-of-ai-in-government_05cfe2bb.html)".

Translation: we're making claims about productivity gains that we're not actually equipped to measure.

## What the Copilot Trial Actually Found

The government conducted its own AI trial. What did it find?

From the [DTA evaluation](https://www.digital.gov.au/initiatives/copilot-trial/microsoft-365-copilot-evaluation-report-full):

- **59% of users found little or no use** for Copilot after the trial
- **60% of outputs required moderate to significant editing**
- **7% of respondents said Copilot added time** to tasks
- The cost-benefit break-even point was **13 minutes of value per week** per user

This is the government's own evidence, from its own trial, with its own staff. It directly contradicts the productivity assumptions underlying the $19 billion projection.

If most users can't find meaningful value in AI tools, and most outputs require substantial editing, where exactly is the 13% productivity gain supposed to come from?

## The Methodology Problem

The Merom report's methodology isn't independently verifiable. The full technical assumptions aren't published. But we can identify some structural issues:

**Selection bias.** Productivity studies often measure only users who successfully adopt AI tools. They don't measure time lost by users who tried and failed, time spent on training, time spent fixing AI errors, or productivity lost to distraction and tool-switching.

**Counterfactual assumptions.** The projections compare AI-enhanced work to unenhanced work. But they don't account for alternative productivity investments: better training, improved processes, upgraded non-AI tools, or simply more staff.

**Assuming away costs.** The $19 billion figure is gross value added. It doesn't subtract implementation costs, licensing fees, infrastructure investments, remediation of AI errors, or costs of managing the workforce disruption the same reports warn about.

**Ignoring quality dimensions.** Productivity metrics typically measure output quantity. They don't measure whether AI-drafted government communications are actually effective, whether AI-influenced decisions are actually correct, or whether AI-enhanced services actually serve citizens better.

## The Claims Table

Let's trace specific claims to their sources:

| Claim | Source | What Source Actually Says |
|-------|--------|---------------------------|
| "$19 billion annual value to public sector" | Merom 2025 (OpenAI-funded) | Conditional projection: "*could* lift... by 13%" |
| "Significant productivity increases" | APS AI Plan | Cites OpenAI-funded report |
| "About an hour per day saved" | Copilot trial | Only among minority who found value; others found little use |
| "Free up staff for higher value work" | Ministerial statements | Copilot trial warned of job displacement risks |
| AI "already contributing $21 billion" to GDP | Merom 2025 | Figure from OpenAI-funded methodology |

Every major productivity claim traces back to industry-funded research or selective interpretation of government trial data.

## The Wage Growth Claims

The Merom report includes some particularly bold claims:

- "Average 7% wage growth across the workforce"
- "Wage growth for women expected to be 35% higher than for men"
- "Small businesses could see productivity improvements 22% faster than larger firms"

These are extraordinary claims. They predict specific wage outcomes based on technology adoption. But they're contradicted by [the government's own trial](https://www.digital.gov.au/initiatives/copilot-trial/microsoft-365-copilot-evaluation-report-full/unintended-outcomes), which explicitly warned:

> "Interviews with Australian Government agencies highlighted that women could be disproportionately impacted as they currently comprise most APS administration staff."

The OpenAI-funded report says AI will boost women's wages. The government's trial says AI may cost women their jobs. One of these is based on industry optimism. The other is based on actual government assessment.

## The Evidence Hierarchy

When evaluating AI productivity claims, consider the evidence hierarchy:

**Strongest evidence:**
- Randomised controlled trials comparing AI-enhanced vs. unenhanced work
- Longitudinal studies tracking actual productivity changes after deployment
- Independent research without funding conflicts

**Moderate evidence:**
- Industry trials with control conditions
- Academic studies with disclosed limitations
- Government evaluations (like the Copilot trial)

**Weakest evidence:**
- Industry-funded projections
- Vendor case studies
- Theoretical modelling without empirical validation

The government's $19 billion claim comes from the weakest category. Its own Copilot trial, moderate evidence, contradicts it.

## What We Actually Know

Based on available evidence:

1. **AI can provide productivity gains for specific tasks.** The Copilot trial found benefits for "basic administrative tasks" among users who found value.

2. **Most users in government contexts find limited value.** 59% found little or no use after a 6-month trial.

3. **AI outputs require substantial human review.** 60% needed moderate to significant editing, partially negating efficiency gains.

4. **Verification costs are real.** Time spent checking AI outputs for errors isn't free productivity; it's additional work.

5. **Benefits are highly variable.** Some users gain; many don't. Aggregate claims mask this distribution.

6. **Industry projections are unreliable.** Vendors have obvious incentives to overstate benefits.

## What Should Be Required

If the government is going to cite productivity claims to justify major technology deployment:

1. **Source transparency.** Don't cite vendor-funded research without disclosure. The APS AI Plan's citation of "Merom, 2025" doesn't tell readers it's OpenAI-funded.

2. **Independent validation.** Commission the Productivity Commission or ABS to independently assess productivity claims before committing to deployment.

3. **Measure actual outcomes.** The Copilot trial was a start. Require ongoing measurement of actual productivity changes after GovAI deployment.

4. **Publish cost-benefit analysis.** Show the full costs, including licensing, infrastructure, training, remediation, and displacement, against the projected benefits.

5. **Account for distribution.** Who gains and who loses? The same reports warning of benefits also warn of concentrated job displacement.

6. **Be honest about uncertainty.** "Could deliver $19 billion" is not the same as "will deliver $19 billion". The conditional language disappears in ministerial talking points.

## The Bottom Line

The $19 billion productivity claim is:

- Sourced from a report funded by OpenAI
- Contradicted by the government's own Copilot trial
- Based on methodology that isn't independently verifiable
- Presented without disclosure of its industry origins
- Conditional on assumptions that may not hold

This isn't evidence-based policy. It's marketing dressed as analysis.

When someone tells you that buying their product will make you 13% more productive, you should be sceptical. When the government tells you the same thing, citing research funded by the company selling the product, you should be very sceptical indeed.
