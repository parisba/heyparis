We recently released a brand new [Try Yarn Spinner](https://try.yarnspinner.dev), which I wrote (more details in the [Yarn Spinner January update](https://www.yarnspinner.dev/blog/monthly_jan_26/)), and I wrote a new demo story too! Check it out below:

<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 2em auto 0;">
<iframe src="https://try.yarnspinner.dev/sample/calibrations/playonly" title="Calibrations Demo" style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 3/4; border: none; border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>
</div>

Technical post on the new Try Yarn Spinner coming soon.
