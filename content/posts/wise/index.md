[Wise](https://wise.com) has stolen more than $60,000 AUD from us, and refuses to let us access it.

[We've](https://secretlab.games) had a Wise account for around 5 years (since they were called TransferWise). It's been a really useful way to transact in foreign currencies, and pay for things when we're travelling for work.

In early-April 2025, Wise asked us to provide some additional information on our Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) by uploading a statement of shareholders, and the ID of the owners. Perfectly reasonable stuff for an entity that pretends to be a bank to us.

In response, in early-April 2025, we uploaded a [paid ASIC Extract](https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/search-fees/) for the business, and scans of the passports of the two UBOs. The message requesting additional information on UBOs went away, and the account continued ticking along. 

On 6 May 2025, with no notice, and with no out of the ordinary or large transactions happening, Wise started declining our card on all transactions, and blocking any ACH/wire transfers out of the account.

There is a link on each declined transaction that says offers a way to fix it:

Alas, it does not, and has never worked:

Every time a transaction declines, we also get an email from Wise:

But again, alas, the "Unblock your account" button in this email also goes to an unhelpful page:

{{< figure src="wise5.png" >}}
 
Lodging a support ticket yields an unhelpful response:

{{< figure src="wise6.png" >}}

And replying makes them more confusing:

{{< figure src="wise7.png" >}}

And then, more confusing still, when they ask for the same documents they already had, again:

{{< figure src="wise8.png" >}}

Calling results in someone in their call centre telling us it's a "bug" and will be "fixed soon", or that I need to upload more documents. And when asked what documents, they list the same document we already uploaded (an ASIC Extract). And round and round we go.

So, we're out $60,000+ AUD, and Wise refuses to help.
