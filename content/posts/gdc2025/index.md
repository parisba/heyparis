We're thrilled to announce that Jon, from the [Secret Lab](https://secretlab.games) and [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev) team will be presenting a talk at the GDC this year in San Francisco: ['DREDGE' and Yarn Spinner: Building Narrative with Open Source](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/dredge-and-yarn-spinner-building-narrative-with-open-source/907181). 

The talk will explore how the indie hit, [DREDGE](https://www.dredge.game), uses our Yarn Spinner technology for narrative, and how you can do the same.
