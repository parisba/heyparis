It's finally done! My [latest book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-swift/9781491923184/), written together with my Jon, is out! It's a fantastic, visual beginners guide to Swift programming, with an emphasis on using Swift Playgrounds. I'm really proud of it.

You can [buy it from all sorts of book shops](https://www.amazon.com/_/dp/1491922850?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&_encoding=UTF8&tag=oreilly20-20), as well as read it on [O'Reilly's Online Learning platform](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-swift/9781491923184/).
