We're thrilled to announce that our next game, [I Feel Fine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2150850/I_Feel_Fine/), is coming out this year! I Feel Fine is developed by studio, [Secret Lab](https://secretlab.games), written by Eisner Award-winning writer [Ryan North](https://www.ryannorth.ca/), powered by [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev), and funded by [Screen Tasmania](https://screen.tas.gov.au/home):

**Great news! You'll be dead in three days.**

Here's the situation. You're a tourism information robot aboard a space station orbiting Jupiter. An asteroid will hit the station in three days, destroying it and everything on it. And you're bolted to the floor.

Don't worry, though. The insurance payout will more than cover the company's costs, and in the meantime, you've got tourism duties to perform.

I Feel Fine is a new adventure game written by Ryan North (MARVEL's Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, Romeo And/Or Juliet, Destiny 2) and built by Secret Lab (Night in the Woods). Talk to people, find out who they are, and try to get one of them to free you before it's too late.

Features:
* A hilarious, bittersweet, and emotional story
* Meet a huge range of characters, from the universe's third-richest person, to a talking dog who's looking to hitch a ride, to a... literal ghost?
* Make careful use of the time you have left to try and persuade someone to free you from certain doom
* Explore multiple endings: find romance and escape to the stars, steal someone's place in the escape pod, or simply get hit by an asteroid and see what that's like
