I'm thrilled to share that we'll be part of [Level Up Tasmania 2024](https://www.screen.tas.gov.au/leveluptasmania), a fantastic celebration of our local game development industry. This event, running from September 27-29, 2024, showcases the creativity and innovation thriving right here in Tasmania.

The main showcase will unfold at PW1 in Hobart on Friday and Saturday, featuring over 30 Tasmanian-made games. It's a rare opportunity to see the breadth of talent we have in our state, all under one roof! Come along?

On Sunday, the [Industry Day](https://www.screen.tas.gov.au/leveluptasmania/industry_day) at the Theatre Royal's Studio Theatre will offer deeper insights into game development. I'm thrilled to be moderating a panel on "Path to Play: Education & Gaming" at 10:20am, featuring some of our industry's brightest minds. And, later, at 12:30pm, Jon Manning and I will be sharing our journey "From Secret Lab to Yarn Spinner." We'll be talking about how our open-source tool, Yarn Spinner, born right here in Hobart, has gone on to impact game storytelling worldwide.
