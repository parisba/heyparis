Today, I got back from the [South Australian Game Exhibition 2025 (SAGE)](https://www.sagameexhibition.com). It was an expo and mini-conference with a showcase, and an awards night, run by the South Australian Film Corporation and the South Australian Games Association, respecively. This was the first time at this fantastic weekend of events for me, and I have to say: I will definitely be back.

[The South Australian games industry is doing really well](https://www.safilm.com.au/latest-news/thousands-flocked-to-adelaides-games-super-showcase-as-sage-2025-reveals-award-winners/). Their events were happy, healthy, passionate, and have a nice community feel that's often lacking from games industry events as they try and professionalise and grow. It was wonderful to see how much camaraderie there is in South Australia. There were also some [fantastic games on display](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/SAGE2025), and many of them were [hilarious](https://www.gadgetguy.com.au/sage-south-australian-game-exhibition-2025-award-winner-pro-jank-footy-cube/).

The awards night was particularly special, as it was the first time they have run them! The winners were all gracious, and shared the spotlight with the other nominees. 

Attending SAGE with my friends and colleagues from Tasmania really helped get a good picture of what we can do for Level Up Tasmania 2025! I can't wait to go back to Adelaide.
