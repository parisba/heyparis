I'm thrilled to, once again, be helping run two of my favourite conferences in the world: [/dev/world](https://devworld.au/index.php) and [X World](https://xworld.au/index.php)! Both are returning to Melbourne, hosted at the fantastic Seek HQ, and the CFP is **open now**.

X World runs 2-3 September 2025 and /dev/world runs 4-5 September 2025.

X World is for those who champion Apple platform users. It covers essential areas like user education, system administration, effective platform deployments, smart device management, and more.

/dev/world is your go-to event if you're a passionate software developer working with, for, or on Apple platforms. Dive into the latest innovations, best practices, and collaborative discussions. Argue about SwiftUI or tell us why Objective-C is still relevant!

The first round CFP is open until 7 July 2025. Get your talks in to [/dev/world](https://devworld.au/cfp/) and [X World](https://xworld.au/cfp/)!

[We](https://auc.edu.au/) have a generous [presenter support policy](https://auc.edu.au/policies/presenter-support/), with the limits increased by $250 AUD if you're also an [AUC Member](https://auc.edu.au/membership/)!
