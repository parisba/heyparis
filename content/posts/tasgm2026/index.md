We just had the AGM for Tasmanian Game Makers, Inc. (TasGM) in Launceston on Friday, and I was thrilled to (once again, somehow) be elected as President! For the fourth year in a row, I'm really grateful for the trust of our members, and I'm excited to work with the new board to keep pushing the video game industry in Tasmania forward.

### The new board is:

* President: Paris B-A
* Vice-Presidents: Michael Hinz, Leo Febey
* Secretary: Tim Nugent
* Treasurer: Jon Manning
* General Committee: Jason Imms, Dean Baron, Lindsay Wells, Lindsay Mansfield, Rhiannon Ross, Alonso Zevallos Fournier, Brie Ratten, and Jerome Phelps

With Oliver Potter continuing as our Screen Tasmania Observer.

Thanks to our outgoing board members, Aaron, Drew, and Bella, as well! We really appreciate your contributions.
