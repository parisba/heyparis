My company [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev) published [a post today](https://www.yarnspinner.dev/blog/why-we-dont-use-ai/) explaining why we don't use AI and won't be adding it to our products.

The TL;DR:

> AI companies make tools for hurting people and we don't want to support that.

From the post:

> If you look at what AI companies promote now, it's not what we wanted. When you boil down everything they say and strip it right back, what they make are tools to either fire people or demand more work without hiring anyone new to help. That's the problem AI companies want to solve.
>
> Anything else they achieve is a happy accident on the road to firing as many of your friends and colleagues as possible.

And on the inevitable "you'll be left behind" argument:

> There's a comment we see every so often, always phrased as a _fait accompli_: "you'll be left behind if you don't adopt AI", or its cousin, "everyone is using it". We disagree.
>
> This isn't the right approach regardless of our opinions on AI. It's tool driven development. The goal should never be "we use this tool". It should be "how do we help you make better games?".
