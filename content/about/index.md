Dr Paris Buttfield-Addison is a technical product leader, author, and computer scientist based in Hobart, Tasmania. He thrives at the intersection of technology, storytelling, and human behavior, consistently applying an interdisciplinary lens to his work, shaped by a background in computer science, law, and medieval history.

Paris is the co-founder of [Secret Lab Pty. Ltd.](https://secretlab.games), an award-winning game development studio best known for the BAFTA- and IGF-winning [Night in the Woods](https://nightinthewoods.com), as well as developing iPad games for ABC Play School and the 'Joey Playbox' for Qantas. He also co-founded [Yarn Spinner Pty. Ltd.](https://yarnspinner.dev), which creates narrative game tools now used by thousands of games played by millions worldwide. Originally created for Night in the Woods, Yarn Spinner has become the industry standard for interactive dialogue systems, powering acclaimed titles such as *DREDGE*, *Venba*, *A Short Hike*, *Little Kitty Big City*, *Rift of the Necrodancer*, *NORCO*, *Demonschool*, *Luma Island*, and *Lost in Random*. Paris led Yarn Spinner's evolution from a single-game tool into a widely-adopted platform, driving product strategy, user research, and cross-functional development to serve developers from indie teams to major studios.

Before founding Secret Lab, Paris worked at Meebo, the consumer web platform that was acquired by Google for $100M, where he contributed to products serving millions of daily users.

Paris holds a PhD in Computing from the University of Tasmania, where his doctoral research explored computational approaches to personal information management and user interaction across diverse digital environments. He also holds an earlier degree in medieval and early-modern history and is currently studying law, a combination that gives him a unique perspective on building products that bridge technical complexity, policy considerations, and human needs. This multidisciplinary approach is evident in Yarn Spinner's design philosophy: its syntax prioritises accessibility for non-technical writers while maintaining powerful features for programmers, a balance that has driven its widespread adoption.

He is the author of over 20 technical [books](/books-and-events/books), published by O'Reilly Media and Wiley's For Dummies imprint (including "iPhone and iPad Game Development For Dummies"). These publications span mobile application development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithms, game design principles, Swift programming, Unity development, and Cocoa frameworks. His writing demonstrates an exceptional ability to translate complex technical concepts for diverse audiences—a skill he brings to product development, where simplifying complexity for users is paramount.

Paris is a regular speaker at international conferences and industry events, delivering [talks and workshops](/books-and-events/events/) that explore the nuances of creative technology and the future of human-driven innovation. He holds a critical view on AI-augmented human creativity. He also hosts a [monthly radio segment on space news](/tags/space-news/) with [Lucie Cutting, on ABC Radio Hobart and Northern Tasmania](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/hobart-sundays), bringing complex scientific topics to mainstream audiences.

Paris has received significant recognition for his contributions to the tech and creative industries. He was the recipient of the prestigious [Pearcey Award](https://www.pearcey.org.au/Awards/) in 2010 for his contributions to the Australian ICT sector. In 2016, he was named a [Gold Disruptor at the Australian Computer Society (ACS) Reimagination Thought Leaders' Summit](https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/2016-acs-digital-disruptors-awards.html). The University of Tasmania presented him with a [Young Alumni Award in 2024](https://www.utas.edu.au/community-and-partners/alumni/our-alumni). Secret Lab's projects have earned numerous industry accolades, including AIMIA, IGF, and BAFTA awards, underscoring their technical and creative excellence. He is also a graduate of the [Tasmanian Leaders Program](https://www.tasmanianleaders.org.au/programs/tas-leaders-program/) (2018), an intensive, year-long initiative that develops high-potential leaders for Tasmania's future.

Paris is actively involved in building and leading technology communities. He serves as the President of [Tasmanian Game Makers, Inc.](https://tasgamemakers.com), promoting local game development and technical skills. He is the Secretary of the [Australasian Apple University Consortium (AUC)](https://auc.edu.au), which supports technology education, and runs [/dev/world](https://devworld.com.au), the longest-running Apple developer conference not run by Apple (since 2008). Together with his [amazing wife](https://themartianlife.com), he is also a co-founder of the [West Coast Space Centre](https://westcoastspacecentre.com), a not-for-profit initiative focused on STEM engagement. Through these roles, Paris has demonstrated his ability to set strategic direction, build sustainable platforms, and grow engaged communities at scale.

Paris lives in Hobart, Tasmania, with his [wife](https://themartianlife.com), and serves as butler to three chihuahuas and a whippet. He's also a [fiction writer](/books/#fiction), [occasional academic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJGJ8f8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), teacher, and enthusiastic amateur [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/parisba/).
