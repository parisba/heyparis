Dr Paris Buttfield-Addison is a creative technologist who works with everything from games and apps to narrative tools and educational resources. 

He is co-founder and creative director of long-running Tasmanian game development studio [Secret Lab](https://secretlab.games), where he has worked on games for QANTAS, CSIRO, Marvel, the ABC, and more. 

He is also co-founder of [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev), a company spun out of the wildly successful game tool of the same name which is used in everything from university curricula to multiple IGF- and BAFTA-winning titles. 

Paris spends much of him remaining time on community support and education in creative and technology industriesâ€”leading boards, running conferences, and more. 

He is the author of nearly 30 technical [books](/books-and-events/books), and is currently working on multiple educational series for both audio and screen. He is also working to improve regional STEM outreach in Tasmania as co-founder of the not-for-profit [West Coast Space Centre](https://westcoastspacecentre.com).
