Dr Paris Buttfield-Addison (he/him) is writer, historian, computer scientist, and creative technologist who creates stories, games, and interactive narratives, for both entertainment and education.

Paris is co-founder and creative director of the longest-running Tasmanian game development studio [Secret Lab Pty. Ltd.](https://secretlab.games), where he has worked on projects for QANTAS, to CSIRO, to TasNetworks, to the ABC, and everything in between, in addition to working on first-party projects, including the BAFTA- and IGF-winning [Night in the Woods](https://nightinthewoods.com).

He is also co-founder of [Yarn Spinner Pty. Ltd.](https://yarnspinner.dev), a company spun out of the wildly successful game tool of the same name originally developed by Secret Lab, and which is used in everything from university curricula to multiple IGF- and BAFTA-winning titles, including DREDGE, Venba, A Short Hike, Little Kitty Big City, and Lost in Random.

Paris spends much of him remaining time on community support and education in creative and technology industriesâ€”leading boards, running conferences, and more. He is the President of [Tasmanian Game Makers, Inc.](https://tasgamemakers.com), the Secretary of the [Australasian Apple University Consortium (AUC)](https://auc.edu.au), and is also working to improve regional STEM outreach in Tasmania as co-founder of the not-for-profit [West Coast Space Centre](https://westcoastspacecentre.com).

Paris is the author of more than 20 technical [books](/books-and-events/books), many of them best-sellers, and is currently working on multiple series for both audio and screen. He lives in Hobart, Tasmania, with his [wife](https://themartianlife.com), and serves as butler to two chihuahuas and a whippet.
