Dr Paris Buttfield-Addison is a technical product leader, author, and computer scientist based in Hobart, Tasmania. His work sits at the intersection of technology, policy, and human behaviour, drawing on a background in computer science, law, and medieval history. He's completing a law degree because he wanted to understand how regulation actually works, particularly for AI.

Paris is the co-founder of [Secret Lab Pty. Ltd.](https://secretlab.games), an award-winning game development studio best known for the BAFTA- and IGF-winning [Night in the Woods](https://nightinthewoods.com), as well as developing iPad games for ABC Play School and the 'Joey Playbox' for Qantas.

He also co-founded [Yarn Spinner Pty. Ltd.](https://yarnspinner.dev), which creates narrative game tools now used by [thousands of games](https://www.yarnspinner.dev/showcase/) played by millions worldwide. Originally created for Night in the Woods, Yarn Spinner has become the industry standard for interactive dialogue systems. It powers acclaimed titles such as *DREDGE*, *Venba*, *A Short Hike*, *Little Kitty Big City*, *Rift of the Necrodancer*, *NORCO*, *Demonschool*, *Luma Island*, and *Lost in Random*.

Paris worked as part of the team that evolved Yarn Spinner from a single-game tool into a widely-adopted platform, supporting product strategy, user research, and cross-functional development to serve developers from indie teams to major studios.

Before founding Secret Lab, Paris worked at Meebo, the consumer web platform that was acquired by Google for $100M, where he contributed to products serving millions of daily users.

Paris holds a PhD in Computing from the University of Tasmania, where his doctoral research examined how people manage information in digital environments. The research focused on actual behaviour rather than idealized models, which shaped his approach to technology: understand how people work, then build systems that match reality. He also holds an earlier degree in medieval and early-modern history. This combination gives him a useful perspective on building products and governance frameworks that bridge technical complexity, policy constraints, and human needs. Yarn Spinner's design philosophy reflects this: its syntax prioritises accessibility for non-technical writers while maintaining powerful features for programmers.

He is the author of over 20 technical [books](/books-and-events/books), published by O'Reilly Media and Wiley's For Dummies imprint (including "iPhone and iPad Game Development For Dummies"). These publications span mobile application development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithms, game design principles, Swift programming, Unity development, and Cocoa frameworks. He writes for developers and policymakers alike, translating technical concepts for different audiences. Paris conducts independent research on AI governance, including his November 2025 examination of the Whole of Government AI Plan, which identified accountability gaps against the Robodebt Royal Commission findings and administrative law principles.

Paris is a regular speaker at international conferences and industry events, delivering [talks and workshops](/books-and-events/events/) that explore the nuances of creative technology and the future of human-driven innovation. He holds a critical view on AI-augmented human creativity. He also hosts a [monthly radio segment on space news](/tags/space-news/) with [Lucie Cutting, on ABC Radio Hobart and Northern Tasmania](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/hobart-sundays), bringing complex scientific topics to mainstream audiences.

Paris has received significant recognition for his contributions to the tech and creative industries. He was the recipient of the prestigious [Pearcey Award](https://www.pearcey.org.au/Awards/) in 2010 for his contributions to the Australian ICT sector. In 2016, he was named a [Gold Disruptor at the Australian Computer Society (ACS) Reimagination Thought Leaders' Summit](https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/2016-acs-digital-disruptors-awards.html). The University of Tasmania presented him with a [Young Alumni Award in 2024](https://www.utas.edu.au/community-and-partners/alumni/our-alumni). Secret Lab's projects have earned numerous industry accolades, including AIMIA, IGF, and BAFTA awards, underscoring their technical and creative excellence. He is also a graduate of the [Tasmanian Leaders Program](https://www.tasmanianleaders.org.au/programs/tas-leaders-program/) (2018), an intensive, year-long initiative that develops high-potential leaders for Tasmania's future.

Paris is actively involved in building and leading technology communities. He serves as the President of [Tasmanian Game Makers, Inc.](https://tasgamemakers.com), where he has led government advocacy that secured policy changes and increased sector funding through sustained engagement with ministers, department heads, and funding bodies at local, state, and federal levels. He is the Secretary of the [Australasian Apple University Consortium (AUC)](https://auc.edu.au), which supports technology education, and runs [/dev/world](https://devworld.com.au), the longest-running Apple developer conference not run by Apple (since 2008). Together with his [amazing wife](https://themartianlife.com), he is also a co-founder of the [West Coast Space Centre](https://westcoastspacecentre.com), a not-for-profit initiative focused on STEM engagement. Through these roles, he's learned to frame technical issues in ways that government understands and acts on.

Paris lives in Hobart, Tasmania, with his [wife](https://themartianlife.com), and serves as butler to three chihuahuas and a whippet. He's also a [fiction writer](/books/#fiction), [occasional academic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJGJ8f8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), teacher, and enthusiastic amateur [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/parisba/).
