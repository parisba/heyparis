Hey! This is a personal website run by me, Paris Buttfield-Addison, from Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Here's the deal on privacy.

**Cookies.** This site sets zero cookies. None. You can check your browser's developer tools right now — there won't be any from this domain.

**Analytics.** This site uses [Umami](https://umami.is), a privacy-focused, cookie-free analytics tool. It collects anonymous, aggregated data — things like which pages get visited and what country visitors are in. No cookies, no fingerprinting, no tracking across sites, no personally identifiable information. The analytics data is hosted by Umami Cloud in the EU. You can't be identified from it and neither can I.

**Hosting.** This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which is operated by GitHub (owned by Microsoft). GitHub may collect technical information like your IP address and browser details in their server logs as part of delivering the site to you. That's between you and GitHub — I don't have access to those logs. You can read [GitHub's privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) for details.

**Email.** If you email me, I'll use your email address to reply to you. I won't add you to a mailing list, sell your details, or share them with anyone unless you ask me to or I'm required to by law.

**No ads, no tracking pixels, no nonsense.** This site doesn't serve ads, collect personal information, or do anything weird with your data.

**Your rights.** Under the Australian Privacy Act 1988, you can ask me what personal information I hold about you (almost certainly none) and request corrections. If you're in the EU, you've got GDPR rights too — but since I don't collect personal data, there's not much to exercise them on.

**Contact.** Questions, complaints, or just want to say hi: _paris AT paris.id.au_.
