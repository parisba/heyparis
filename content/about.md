He is co-founder and creative director of long-running Tasmanian game development studio Secret Lab, where he has worked on games for QANTAS, CSIRO, Marvel, the ABC, and more. 

He is also co-founder of Yarn Spinner, a company spun out of the wildly successful game tool of the same name which is used in everything from university curricula to multiple IGF- and BAFTA-winning titles.
