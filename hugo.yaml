    Title: "Paris Buttfield-Addison"
    Content: |
      Hi! I'm a computer scientist, game designer, writer, artist, and technical product leader based in Hobart. I work at the intersection of technology, policy, and human behaviour. I co-founded [Secret Lab](https://secretlab.games), the indie studio behind BAFTA-winning *Night in the Woods* and the ABC Play School games. I also co-founded [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev), narrative tools used in [thousands of games](https://www.yarnspinner.dev/showcase/) played by millions including *DREDGE*, *A Short Hike*, and *Venba*.
      <br /><br />
      I've [written over 20 technical books](/books-and-events/books/) on AI, machine learning, and software development. I'm completing a law degree because I wanted to understand how regulation works, particularly for AI. I do independent research on [AI governance](/tags/ai/), analysing gaps between policy, law, and how people actually behave when using these systems.
      <br /><br />
      I help run [/dev/world](https://devworld.au) (longest-running Apple developer event not run by Apple, since 2008), serve as President of [Tasmanian Game Makers](https://www.tasgamemakers.com), and [host a radio show on space news](/tags/space-news/). I've worked at Meebo (acquired by Google) and delivered [keynotes and workshops worldwide](/books-and-events/events/).
      <br /><br />
      [Learn more about me](/about). My amazing wife Mars is [here](https://themartianlife.com).
