    Content:
        **Hi, I'm Dr Paris Buttfield-Addison 👋**
        <br /><br />
        I co-founded [Secret Lab](https://secretlab.games) (indie games studio behind the ABC Play School games, and BAFTA and IGF-winning *Night in the Woods*) and [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev)—narrative tools powering thousands of games played by millions, including *DREDGE*, *A Short Hike*, *Venba*, and *Unbeatable*.
        <br /><br />
        I'm a technical product leader with a multidisciplinary background: law degree, history major, trained engineer. I've worked at Meebo (acquired by Google), [authored over 20 technical books on software development, game design, artificial intelligence, and machine learning](/books/#books). I've delivered [keynotes, presentations, and workshops at conferences worldwide](/books-and-events/events/), and [host a radio show covering space news](/posts/spacenews/). I build products at the intersection of technology, policy, storytelling, and human behavior, helping to translate complex systems into experiences and tools that millions of people actually use.
        <br /><br />
        I run [/dev/world](https://devworld.com.au), the longest-running Apple developer event not run by Apple (since 2008), serve as Secretary of the [AUC](https://www.auc.edu.au), and lead Tasmania's game development ecosystem as President of [Tasmanian Game Makers, Inc.](https://www.tasgamemakers.com) and coordinator of the [Tasmanian Games Incubator](https://secretlab.games/incubator).
        <br /><br />
        I'm also a [fiction writer](/books/#fiction), [occasional academic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJGJ8f8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), teacher, and enthusiastic amateur [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/parisba/).
        <br /><br />
